## go-abac

implement attribute based access control in golang

main referenceï¼š
[accessControl](https://github.com/onury/accesscontrol)

however, to simplify(?) the design, we decide to stick to the definition of abac, without the attribute role   
instead focus on the wider range of subject(including role/department/project)
